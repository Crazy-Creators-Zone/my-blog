  NOTE:
    - Each Method in the ArticlesController Ð¡lass is called > Action.

    - By default, the name of the Method|Action and View > Must be identical.
          ==> That is, the Method|Action must > Refer to app/views/articles/action_name.html.erb
                                              > Have a view app/views/articles/action_name.html.erb
Example:
  Method|Action > index
  View          > index.html.erb  
  Route         > "http://localhost:3000/articles"

  Method|Action > show
  View          > show.html.erb
  Route         > "http://localhost:3000/articles/id" 

    - When an action does not explicitly render a view (or otherwise trigger an HTTP response)
          ==> Rails will automatically render a view that matches the name of the controller and action. Convention Over Configuration!
            ==> Views are located in the app/views directory.
Example:
  Controller    > articles_controller.rb
  Method|Action > index

  View          > articles
                > index.html.erb
                                  ==> articles/index.html.erb
